Description: Provides a lightweight interface for black-box REST API testing and analysis 
    through integration with a Kotlin-based sampling engine derived from the open-source 
    EvoMaster framework (Apache 2.0 License). The package generates, encodes, and executes 
    random HTTP requests against a target OpenAPI specification, returning structured 
    response data for use in downstream statistical and machine learning analysis within R.
