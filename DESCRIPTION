Description: Provides a lightweight interface for black-box REST API testing and analysis through integration with a Kotlin-based sampling engine derived from the open-source EvoMaster framework (see <doi:10.1145/3293455> and <doi:10.21105/joss.02153>). The package generates, encodes, and executes random HTTP requests against a target OpenAPI specification, returning structured response data for use in downstream statistical and machine learning analysis within R.
